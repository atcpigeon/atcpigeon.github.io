        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project is part of CS180: Intro to Computer Vision and Computational Photography. The goal is to colorize the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection by aligning the red, green, and blue channels of each image.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="approach">
        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>I implemented a two-stage process: first, a naive alignment method using exhaustive search, and then an optimized pyramid-based alignment for high-resolution images. Below are some example results using both methods.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <h3>Naive Alignment</h3>

    <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
        <p>One of the main challenges was aligning high-resolution images efficiently. The pyramid approach significantly reduced the computational cost while maintaining accuracy. I also had to handle different brightness levels between channels, which I addressed using Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) as a matching metric.</p>

    <section id="extra">
        <h2>Bells & Whistles</h2>
        <p>For extra credit, I implemented automatic cropping to remove misaligned borders, automatic contrast adjustment, and explored white balancing techniques to enhance image quality.</p>
